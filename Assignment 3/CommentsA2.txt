This article doesn't tell me how the system works. I'm not any closer to understanding if we become ashes or just let us decompose like fruits and vegetables do in a compost pile. I want to be supportive but I need more details to be 100% behind it.
I do not care.
But just like normal burials / cremation that's a cost borne by the person who wants to be composted not the state
Bill Aubuchon I'm a funeral director. We had the pleasure of having a presentation from Katrina where the price question was asked and answered.
Bill Aubuchon It would be a bit more than a direct cremation but way less than a burial.
The bill passed and I've seen an article suggesting the cost will be $5500.
I would love to grow a plant (food) in gramma.. my dogMy Ex...Not sure how I feel about this overall
Doesn't this happen anyway? 
Nichole welp. That's one way to dispose of a body
Do you think human remains would be left in the compost is that why you are saying this?
Thats not so bad
Would they use the compost to fertilize cemeteries?
Marcelle Baldwin you give no source for your number can I assume that you got it from a 4 year old New York Times article? We'll see and I hope you are right but my guess is it will be at least double that figure.
Good politics for the state but it may just bee too progressive for a national stage. It freaks me out a little and I'm a lifelong Liberal.
Lacey Sutton love her so much
Thanks for the info...not tryna pay so much...
If you're dying make sure to eat a bunch of seeds and cut out the middleman!
Human to humus.
So does this mean: with bodies being fertilizer that whatever grows is no longer "vegan"?? Does that make us in some way cannibals?? 
Just throw grandma in the compost heap with the yard waste and banana peels.
Jan Van Liew um nope
Darrell Eugenio taxes you choose to pay so those poor job creators can survive.  . You voted for the interlopers.  Beware of what you wish for.
Cremation is the way to go "ashes to ashes dust to dust"
Joslin Jane Yes but I don't want to be "worm food" and the longer your corpse exist the more opportunity to become a museum exhibit.
Shara Roberts Somehow I'm afraid I'll know.  It's the fear of being buried alive that gets me
That's disgusting but doesn't that happen all the time.
We're gonna end up with a lot of over-caffeinated plants.
Why stop there?  #SoylentGreen
It's people!
I came to this post just for the soylent green comments. Took forever reading to find your post
I think the governator should be the first one to fertilize the peyote he's been smoking
Do we have to call Seattle Public Utilities ahead of time to arrange it or can my wife just chuck me in the green bin?
Mark Gendron just be sure they don't charge you extra!
Num num this cabbage was made with uncle Mikes help!
Remember the movie Soylent Green?
Soylen Green is people!
Adds a whole new dimension to Grandma"s tomatoes!
Composting is too much work. I'd rather do it Frank's way.
I don't want your dead uncle Wilbur and aunt Flora in my back yard! 
It's still too expensive though.
While it's a great idea for the peons I shall still move forward with my plan for interment in a Pyramid.
Oh boy what could possibly go wrong? 
Our governor is the worst!
Heather Cole He's an absolute moron. You're being too kind. 
thats wrong on so many levels
How about tackling the drug use and the Homeless Problem and the streets falling apart before you sign a stupid Bill such as this
Dear Loved Ones please don't do this to me.
Soylent green is people
SOYLENT GREEN IS PEOPLE!
Soylent green maybe?
Soylent Green.......
Soylent Green is next.
That is disgusting.
Soylent Green...coming to a store near you.
HOW CREEPY&amp; APPALLING
that is just plain wrong.
Fanfuckingtastic
**barfs a little in mouth**
Stupidest idea ever
WTF is wrong with WA!
It's still going to cost you an arm and a leg.
Soylen Green is people!
Soylen Green is people!
Cremation-where wants the ashes-dpnt want to be a mud pie-rather have memorial day and remember persons soul that has departed
OMG.  Who is this person?  Of course I know "who" he is.  I cannot believe this--just like his signing of "reproductive parity."  (If you don't know what that is look it up!  I doubt if the people of the state are even aware of what is being passed by the legislature!)
Jules Villarreal CHINGOW

Next up... soylent green
LeeAnn Hemmingson Sievers Exactly!
Enyaj Nesroht I'm saying it as a joke
WTF ????

Enyaj Nesroht still scary.  Cemetary in your backyard.  Yikes.Carmen SipesRachel Benz CostenbaderDemian Hardaker
Bill Brower man..We have enough competition--
Why did i move here lol
WTF.
cremate me first or I'll haunt you!
Ryan THIS LMAO
This has to be the most sickening thing I have ever seen in my life omg are you kidding me fake has to be totally Fake
Should we be releasing all those drugs back into the environment?Most elderly are on many prescriptions
What the hell is wrong with you people?
Not so sure I like this idea? What about diseases infections?
Barbaric! Just one step away from canabalism. Which has been slipped in till discovered.
I'm with you
Audra R McCoy be careful which one you get. Some are scams.  you need to have spores from the area you're buried
Audra R McCoy The field testing didn't show any difference than bodies buried without the suit but they're still charging between hundreds and thousands of dollars for the product  Eek.
So I can be a tree?!
!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rtu1Va-dnM
If you wanna get fancy you can  have your ashes mixed with cement to create a reef to be dropped into the ocean to help dying reefs return. Cool concept! https://www.cremation.com/cremation.../eternal-reefs/
And it smells good too!
Yayyyyy
the essence of recycling!
Another win for the interment industry. I'll consider it a win when we're allowed to dig a hole and plant a tree over my body.
You might be able to because many places DO allow private internment given the right paperwork 
When science is done having it's way with my body I want whatever is left to be composted.  Hopefully by the time I need it human composting will be a legal and local service here too.
Go to the recompose website. They explain their process there.https://www.recompose.life/faq
https://recompose.life/our-model/#faq
Fascinating. I didn't cremation process was not good for the environment either. I need to do more research on that as well. This is opening a topic that needed to be discussed. I'm glad this article brought to light this important information.
Awesome! I've always said I'd like to forgo the casket and be fertilizer. The Earth's perfect attributes as a planet brought me to life so I think it's only fair I give back what I can when I'm not using it anymore.
Good bye mega billion dollar funeral industry.
I've always imagined myself dying under a tree leaning against it's trunk..found by no one..left to the elements. Recomposting seems about the same 
Excellent idea I love Seattle is the best city in the world.
As someone who has a very high chance of needing this in the next five years I'm in favor of being spread throughout Seattle my favorite city.  Perhaps I should think about end-of-life here.
This would be my choice.  Hope it passes.
Cate Callahan it only needs the governor's signature!
This is my first choice. I hope this bill passes before I do.
This is exactly how human remains should be. All of us started from dust...our bodies should replenish our mother earth.
Mushroom suit burial...removes years of rx contamination creates clean compost.  Interesting TED talk
I just learned about "water" cremation (alkaline hydrolosis) last summer when my dog passed away. I took her to a place in West Seattle that does it. I didn't have her composted though. There was bone ash left over and I took those home as I wasn't ready to let her go.
Marcie Paradis Was it Resting Waters Aquamation? They're amazing!
AJ Hawkins Yes! They are wonderful!
I told my kids i want to sustain a tree... this is beautiful
Eco-Transitions will assist you once this is passed. Check them out on FB!
I'm still holding out for a Tibetan sky burial. Feed me to the vultures and eagles.
I am with you but I want to feed my local wildlife.  I want to go to the coyotes and other critters of Oklahoma.
Nathan Brookshire cremation has a highly negative impact on the earth. Why would a body burning be better than just returning to the earth as soil? Under this bill you can not be aquamated and still become ashes by way of water instead of fire!
Look up "Capuchini burial."  Monks have been doing this for centuries.  Bones seem to remain intact though.
I want to be cremated primarily because I'm claustrophobic and can't imagine being in a box for all eternity but I like this composting as long as I don't have to be in a box.  However ashes should be about the same don't you think?  then you can spend eternity where ever you choose to be scattered
Jill Eshenbaugh you can still be scattered anywhere. Just as rich soil instead of minerals. 
As long as it doesn't involve being in a box for any length of time sounds like a good plan.
It's OK Jill. You'll be dead and won't even notice or care. 
Anything aside from embalming and boxes that will never decompose.
Washington State - the New California!!  So cool!
I WANNA BE COMPOSTED SO BAD. I'm so excited
Sweet! I can give back instead of wasting a plot of land!
This is awesome! We simply cannot continue to use land to bury a body in a cement crypt. Do something more positive for the environment. We have future generations to think about. I think everyone should try to leave this earth a little bit better than it was when they first entered it.
Not to mention all the embalming chemicals 
I for one am looking forward to becoming a flesh slurry for the benefit of... well I guess I don't care because I'll be dead 
Humans  (meat in general) don't make very GOOD compost but this is definitely a step in the right direction. The crazy industry around (unsuccessful) preservation of human remains merely renders them toxic and is a predatory financial drain on people who are usually not in any shape to make rational decisions and are instead guilted into extravagance. For someone who is dead.My own plan is to cremated and placed into the Sound. If my family wants to handle that I'd like it to be off the back of a ferry during commute hours so my death can inconvenience as many people as possible. If y family can't handle it then all they have to do is leave my corpse unclaimed at any Seattle area hospital and I'll end up in the Sound anyway A great series is "Ask A Mortician" by Caitlin Doughty and The Order of The Good Death. https://www.youtube.com/user/OrderoftheGoodDeath/videosHer book "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes" is an excellent read about the legalities and realities surrounding death and after-death care here in the US and the industry established around it. https://www.amazon.com/.../ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0
(My experience in this is working as an assistant to Forensic Anthropologists and as an archaeologist and as someone who has helped my family and others navigate this system. )Trust me embalming only delays the inevitable by a few months you don't WANT a "sealed" casket and paying for a hardwood fully upholstered death-cabinet is a scam. Cremation should be no more than $800 (really it SHOULD be less) and use a cardboard casket--they almost never burn the actual casket if you pay for that since they don't fit well in the retorts metal hardware damages the firebrick surface and it messes with the temperature and time of cremation as well as the retrieval of cremains.What you CAN do: Plan for the literally inevitable. Death is one of the only certainties in life and a lot can be researched done or paid for years in advance keeping costs low and streamlining things for your family. It is not morbid to plan these things--if your family is uncomfortable just tell them that you are thinking of them and want to remove the uncertainty of the whole process during a time they do not need any more stress. Inform them that they OWN YOUR REMAINS. Not the hospital. Not whatever funeral service the hospital contracts. Any attempt to bluff and claim it is "illegal" to have your loved one transferred to another less expensive facility or even to take temporary possession of their body yourself is  a lie. Do research the laws in your area but in most locations there is a time limit for internment and some restrictions around transporting uncremated human remains not  laws against doing it yourself in the first place. May localities even still allow internment on private property with the correct paperwork.And there are (especially here in the PNW) 'green' options.  I'm happy that one more will be added to the list 
If properly treated meat bone and even dairy can work well for compost.The composting service we use allows all of those along with stone-fruit pits etc.  The only kinds of things you can't throw in are pan drippngs and oil/fats in bulk.They use an industrial shredder to manually break everything down before it's put to the composting heaps.
This bill is exactly what Washington needs. We now have two of the greenest death care options available in addition to many green burial cemeteries. It's a huge victory!
Humans would be easier to compost than large animals i.e horses cows etc. Look up "hot composting" of livestock.  "Composting is a biological process: aerobic microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) convert raw organic waste into stable nutrient-rich organic matter."  Also recommend a thorough reading through of the website. It changed my mind about cremation."Cremation the other most popular choice burns fossil fuels and emits about 600 million pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually â€“ that's the equivalent of more than 70000 cars driving the road for a year.In other words the very last thing that most of us will do on this earth is poison it."https://bit.ly/2IS3X7Qhttps://www.recompose.life/
Let's face it a box topped with flowers while an organ plays in the background is much sadder than this.
Nate Dwyer see it's a thing  I can soon update my burial demands from becoming a tree to this-
So thrilled this will be an option. Embalming burial and cremation all have negative effects on the environment.
beats hell out of burying bodies in concrete vaults for no sane reason ever
Mary Roach wrote on the subject years ago in her 2003 book "Stiff"' and she makes a convincing argument for it. If we all support the concept the costs should come down to a very minimal amount less than cremation.
Dennis Carver love all her books 
Dennis Carver a great book. Actually very funny in places.
Kathleen DeBoer my favorite chapter was about the site where corpses decompose for science.
The Seattle Times not a word on what the cost might be how it might compare to conventional options such as cremation or burial? Still I love the idea!
Bill Aubuchon $2500
Mary Park or perhaps a cost borne by the person who can afford to be composted? Hopefully it will offer competitive pricing to conventional options it's a great idea!
From earlier articles (in the past 6 months) the cost of composting would be significantly cheaper.
David Overman cheaper than what? Perhaps cheaper than a full blown burial but almost assuredly much more expensive than conventional cremation. Still if I could afford it I would choose it!
Marcelle Baldwin and in my opinion well worth it!
Would love to know my body was nurturing the earth
Another one Podlodowski can add to her list.  Praise the state.
I thought the homeless camps were contributing to human composting but in seriousness this would be a good change Maybe we can use existing cemeteries for shelter
I'd rather my remains end up as part of nature helping other living things grow than  chemically pickled in toxins and put in an expensive hermetically sealed box.https://www.thelivingurn.com/pages/tree-zip-code...

Worst compost ever full of pesticides medication and process food chemicals.  But beats the heck out of burying or burning.
Naw Im holding out for sky burials.
I would totally do this when I die.
Please someone standardize tree burials before I need one!
Just don't compost me with kale. 
good - we come from the earth we should give back to the earth when we die
You mean actually allow people to decompose like we were intended to? Get outta here...
Ima be a tree!
Totally for it
Plant a tree....In ME!
I would love to grow a tree from me
It's about time.
Good direction!
Burial at sea same effect.
Sounds good!!
Please! I want this for myself!
Hummm. I like this!
No problem ... im down with it
More sustainable options! Please make sure to get your wishes on paper. A Sacred Passing
I'm already set to be buried in a Natural Cemetery. They will wrap me in a shroud throw me in a hole and plant a tree on top of me 
Amanda Neeser lol!!! I'm ready! My general manager was actually working with the legislature on this 
Human remains have long been composted underground.
Dude you can use my body as soil for a pot plant like in how high Rhiannon Kettenbauerhttps://youtu.be/D7g3RuoreRc
Chansodany Daisy Keth Sodalin Kong when it's my time to go; use me in your garden.
Sign me up!  VicBodhi BeRachel Vulk…
Kristin Helland I'm in
Too cool
Do it do it do it
Great news!
Yay!
Yes please!
Very cool.
Sign me up.
Cool. I'm in.
Doing it
Erin Lynn Sattler one more reason for me to move there.
Sign me up.
Michelle Dawson not freaky once you learn how science works
Shae Garcia I've been following the woman that's leading this innovative change. Now they just need the governor to sign the resolution.
Yes!!!!
Yay
Amber hah! I was gonna do it with or without a law anyway 
Kate Silbaugh turns  out it  may also  be  cheaper  than cremation!
Amber Toombs Freeman my last will and testament says cremation. I may reconsider. Lol. I may just make someone's lawn even greener or vegetable garden grow even faster!
Why is this not a thing already and why does it take a law to allow it?! So weird
Amber Westad thank gawd. My dreams are coming true.
Madison make me into a sunflower please
You're going in my garden someday mom! Jackie Gauvin 
Hailey Callahan Lisa Marie Juan I was JUST saying this
Trent Hodson thanks for pinging this! as per my previous text i'd like to be a body on this pile. CC'ing Ani on this for visability
Dusty Brown day what?!  But cool
What's sickening about nature? I've been hoping for this for years.
Terri Stewart If you learn about the process it's actually very dignified as well as being better for the earth. Recomposition and aquamation are my fear and second choices for my body and I'm glad I'll be able to have the right to the disposition want. It's okay if it's not for you! 
And I'm in contact with Katrina the inventor and want to bring her technology to the UK unless something else crops up first!
OliviaAddie ......FINALLY.
Marc Hartwell yessss
just like the old daze before we got "civilized" and back to using wooden box caskets
Kylee Date if this passes itl finally be legal to have yourself turned into a tree when you die
Jacob Gloss yayty
Jacob Gloss me too me too!
Ember Ellis well its just one signature away from being legal!! Which would be awesome. Currently youd have to have your corpse sent to europe to get something like that done
